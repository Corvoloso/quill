## üñ§ About the project
Intended to be a Dracula but black, i've used the Omni theme from @Rocketseat
base and turned the lights off.

## üöÄ How to use

The project isn't on the VSCode Marketplace **yet**, if you want to use it nowadays you have to do it manually.

```bash
# you need to enter the extensions file of your vscode. (in windows or mac)
$ cd ~/.vscode/extensions

# in the extensions folder clone the project
$ git clone https://github.com/Corvoloso/quill.git

# now open the VSCode menu "show all commands" usually with ctrl/command + shift + p, and search for "Color Theme" to change it
# if in doubt check your vscode shortcuts.
```
